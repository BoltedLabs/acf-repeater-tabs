# acf-repeater-tabs
A tabbed-view extension to Advanced Custom Field PRO's repeater fields

Currently works with: ACF PRO

## Using the plugin

### WARNING: There are a few bugs currently being worked on, foremost being nested repeaters not tabbing correctly. Will wupdate asap.

The plugin extends repeaters following the "Block" styling.

Simply install and activate, the plugin will detect any repeater rows using "Block".

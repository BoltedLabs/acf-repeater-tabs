# acf-repeater-tabs
## v3.0
A tabbed-view extension to Advanced Custom Field PRO's repeater fields

Stable compatibility: ACF PRO v5.5.12 +

## Using the plugin

The plugin extends the ACF Pro Repeaters Fields.

Once you have installed and activated, you will find a new radio field when setting up your repeater fields called **"Activate Repeater Tabs"**.

You can either leave this off, or turn it on for Vertical layout tabs. 

*(Horizontal has been removed until a smarter layout can be achieved).*

Turn this on, and the repeater tabs will appear for this field.

Drag and drop the tabs to reorder.

Hover for half a second, and you will be given the option to "Copy" the current tab, duplicating it and it's contents to a new row at the bottom of your repeater list.

This works best with the **"Block"** view, however works with all three (Table, Block, Row).

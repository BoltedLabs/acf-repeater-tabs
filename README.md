# acf-repeater-tabs
## v2.7
A tabbed-view extension to Advanced Custom Field PRO's repeater fields

Stable compatibility: ACF PRO v5.5.12

## Using the plugin

The plugin extends the ACF Pro Repeaters Fields.

Once you have installed and activated, you will find a new radio field when setting up your repeater fields called **"Activate Repeater Tabs"**.

You can either leave this off, or turn it on for Horizontal, or Vertical layout tabs.

Turn this on, and the repeater tabs will appear for this field.

Drag and drop the tabs to reorder.

This works best with the **"Block"** view, however works with all three (Table, Block, Row).

# acf-repeater-tabs
## v2.0
A tabbed-view extension to Advanced Custom Field PRO's repeater fields

Currently works with: ACF PRO

## Using the plugin

The plugin extends the ACF Pro Repeaters Fields.

Once you have installed and activated, you will find a new checkbox when setting up your repeater fields called **"Activate Repeater Tabs"**.

Turn this on, and the repeater tabs will appear for this field.

This works best with the **"Block"** view, however works with all three (Table, Block, Row).
